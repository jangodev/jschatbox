# update 4/15/23 - this is a teribble skidded socket.io project from repl. don't use it as it is very vulnerable to XSS attacks. I was very dumb back when I made this 2 years ago.

# Orbit Chatbox V.1.1
A chatbox made with js and html.
This is mainly used for schools since discord and other messaging softwares are usually blocked.

# Bookmarklet suggested
This chatbox is suggested to be used as a bookmarklet, so it won't show in your history (and don't have to annoyingly delete it everytime.)

You can find the code for the bookmarklet in bookmarklet.js


# You can use the chatbox site 

You can also use the site to access the Orbit Chatbox and start messaging your friends.

# Extra Info: 

Torch is partnering up with Orbit!

Orbit is a free school-bypass chatbox to chat with people no matter what there location is. 

Join the server for the code (used as a bookmark, similar to torch).

Orbit will soon also be having a school bypass system like torch, but more advanced. If it does well enough, we might even combine torch with Orbit.

Thank you.

# Don't know what torch is? See my Torch respitory on my profile. 
I'm planning on combining orbit and torch into one thing, with a chatbox and a school exploit on one site.
